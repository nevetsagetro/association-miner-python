#### Description:

**Association Miner** is a specialized data science tool developed as my final project for CS50. It is designed to uncover hidden patterns and consumer behavior trends within retail transaction data. Based on the data mining principles of **Market Basket Analysis**, this project allows business owners and analysts to identify which products are frequently purchased together. 

By calculating essential metrics like **Support, Confidence, and Lift**, the program transforms raw CSV data into actionable strategic insights. These insights help businesses make informed decisions regarding product placement (grouping related items), cross-selling strategies, and the creation of promotional bundles to increase revenue.

The project was inspired by the real-world application of the Apriori principle. I wanted to build a tool that wasn't just a spreadsheet processor, but a descriptive engine that tells a story about consumer behavior through automated visualizations and a "Hidden Gem" detection system that highlights the most non-obvious but strong relationships in the data.

### 📂 File Descriptions

* **`project.py`**: This is the main script of the application. It contains the logic for loading data via Pandas, cleaning null values, generating item combinations, calculating statistical metrics, and triggering the visualization engine.
* **`data/`**: A dedicated directory for input CSV files. The program is designed to look here for datasets that include at least a `transaction_id` and a `product` column.
* **`requirements.txt`**: This file lists the Python dependencies required to run the project, including `pandas` for data handling, `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for generating graphs, and `fpdf` for PDF generation capabilities.
* **`top_products_frequency.png`**: A bar chart generated by the script that visualizes the top 10 most frequently purchased products in the dataset.
* **`association_map.png`**: A sophisticated scatter plot created by the script. It maps every discovered product relationship into strategic quadrants: "Golden Rules," "Opportunities," and "Staples."
* **`recommendations.csv`**: A structured output file that saves all calculated association rules, allowing the user to explore the raw data in Excel or other BI software.

### 🛠️ How it Works

The tool follows a rigorous data processing pipeline to ensure accuracy:
1.  **Data Intake**: It prompts the user for a filename and validates the existence of the file in the `data/` folder.
2.  **Basket Transformation**: It groups individual product rows into
